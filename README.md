# Silent Crash in Node.js Server Due to Unhandled Async Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js servers: silent crashes due to unhandled errors in asynchronous operations.  The server doesn't send a response when an asynchronous task fails, leading to unresponsive behavior.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a Node.js HTTP server that performs an asynchronous operation. If this operation fails, the server doesn't gracefully handle the error. This results in the server continuing to run but without sending a response to the client, creating a situation where requests are not responded to.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach.  It includes comprehensive error handling within the asynchronous operation's `catch` block.  If an error occurs, it sends an appropriate error response to the client, preventing the silent failure and improving the overall robustness of the server.

This is crucial for building reliable and maintainable Node.js applications.
